 I made this form control for a challenge given by https://github.com/ad-my-brand/coding-challenge-frontend

 I completed this challenge using Html, Css, JavaScript and React .
 I have not used any API because as now I am not familiar with it as mention in challenge 


 But I am well good in Html, CSS and JavaScript with knowledge of ReactJs.

 Thank you for Reading
